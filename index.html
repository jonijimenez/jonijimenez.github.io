          <p>Lewis was schoolsed by private tutors until age 9, when his mother died in 1908 from cancer</p>

          <p>Lewis was raised in a religious family that attended the Church of Ireland. He became an <strong>atheist</strong> at age 15, though he later described his young self as being <strong><em>"paradoxically angry with God"</em></strong> for not existing. His early separation from Christianity began when he started to view his religion as a chore and a duty, around this time, he also gained an interest in the occult, as his studies expanded to include such topics. Lewis quoted Lucretius as having one of the strongest case for atheism</p>

          <p>Lewis interest in the works of George MacDonald was part of what turned him from atheism. This can be seen particularly well through his paased in Lewis' The Great Divorce chapter 9, when the semi-autobiographical main character meets MacDonald in Heaven.</p>

          <p>He eventually returned to Christianity, having been influenced by argument with his Oxford colleague and Christian friend J.R.R. Tolkien whom se seems to have met for the first time on May 1, 1926</p>
